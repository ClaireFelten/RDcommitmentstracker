Its decision aligns with the company’s ongoing assessment of future vaccine requirements in the region. The planned facility’s viability is currently under threat as Africa’s need for Covid-19 vaccines has diminished since the height of the pandemic. Moderna has not secured any vaccine orders for African nations since 2022. The cancellation of existing orders has led to losses and write-downs exceeding $1bn for the company.

Apr/2024: Africa CDC announced its disappointment that Moderna has put a pause in its plans to build a vaccine manufacturing facility in Kenya. While reflecting on the nuances of the decreased need and demand of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa, Africa CDC concluded that ""to blame Africa and Africa CDC for lack of demand for covid-19 vaccines and therefore the reason to put on hold plans to manufacture vaccines in Africa, only serves to perpetuate the inequity that characterized the response to the Covid–19 pandemic.","https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/moderna-kenya-mrna-facility/
